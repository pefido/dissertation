\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{cha:evaluation}
In this chapter we present the evaluation of the work done. This will measure the performance and scalability of the integration by presenting benchmarks of the running system.

\section{Operation Propagation Time}
\label{sec:operation_propagation_time}
In this section we will focus on measuring the propagation time of system operations and how it fluctuates with other variables. This evaluation will be parted in two directions. The time that an operation takes to travel from Legion to Antidote, and from Antidote to Legion. The main difference between these two ways is based on the reactive or pro-active way that the system propagates the updates. In section \ref{sec:legion_to_antidote_evaluation} we benchmark  the propagation of updates from Legion to Antidote and in section \ref{sec:antidote_to_legion_evaluation} from Antidote to Legion.
