\acknowledgements

I would firstly like to thank my adviser professors, Nuno Preguiça and João Leitão for helping and pushing me ahead throughout this thesis, to Albert Linde for helping me with Legion related questions and to the other msc students with related thesis that I was able to share information with. I would also like to thank the SyncFree consortium members that made their time to help me. This work was partially supported by EU FP7 SyncFree project (609551).\par
	Besides the ones who directly helped me with the work, I would also like to think my colleagues that were either also doing their thesis or having classes for motivating me along the way. Also a thanks to my hometown friends for always cheering me up, and last but not least, a big thanks to my parents that made possible for me to take part in this course. I do apologize if at this time I forgot to mention someone.
